# 🚀 AI-Powered Creator Brand Builder MCP

## Overview

**Creator Brand Builder MCP** is an open, programmable **Micro Context Protocol (MCP)** server + cloud deployment system that lets **content creators** automatically spin up a **public, branded website** — complete with:

* 📚 A custom CMS for posts, videos, courses
* 🗓️ Integrated booking links (Cal.com, Calendly)
* 💵 E-commerce tools for paid memberships, merch, donations

* Manages newsletters
* Deploys & updates a live branded site with zero-code
